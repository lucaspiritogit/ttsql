# Text-to-SQL TUI App

A local, Dockerized natural-language-to-SQL application.

The user asks a question in a terminal UI, the backend asks a locally hosted model to generate SQL, executes the SQL against a PostgreSQL database seeded from `data.csv`, and returns the generated SQL plus the query result.

## Project structure

I decided to create a monorepo with both `client` and `server` to separate concerns. Each module has its own Dockerfile and we have a `docker-compose` on root to have all the applications running.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## How to run the project

### 1. Build and start all services detached

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### 2. Pull the local model

The Ollama container needs the configured models available locally. Pull them once:

```bash
docker compose exec model ollama pull pxlksr/defog_sqlcoder-7b-2:Q2_KS
docker compose exec model ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:1.5b
```

### 3. Run the TUI

```bash
docker compose run --rm client
```

## Database

The database is initialized by `db/init.sql` when the Postgres container starts for the first time.

It creates a single `sales` table and imports `data.csv`:

## Design decisions and trade-offs

### Model choice

The default model is:

```txt
pxlksr/defog_sqlcoder-7b-2:Q2_KS
```

This model is specialized for text-to-SQL generation, which should improve SQL accuracy compared with a general coding model. The trade-off is that it is larger and may require more local resources.

A second lightweight SLM is used only after SQL execution to turn result rows into a short natural-language explanation. SQL generation still uses SQLCoder, and the UI keeps the generated SQL visible alongside the rows and explanation.

The explanation model defaults to:

```txt
qwen2.5-coder:1.5b
```

## Scaling the project

If the dataset grew to many larger tables, I would first make schema handling more explicit instead of injecting one static schema string. The backend could retrieve only the relevant schema fragments for each question before prompting the agent. I would also add indexes for common filters. We can also implement database replication in case of a huge ingress, and make tables into VIEWS for affordable SELECTs.

For high traffic, the services should be scaled independently:

- Run multiple API containers behind a load balancer.
- Keep Postgres as a managed/primary database with connection pooling, like PgBouncer.
- Deploy the models on a dedicated GPU-based VM, or use something like OpenRouter for inference.
- Add caching.

## AI usage

For this exercise I used [Pi](https://pi.dev/) as the coding-agent harness with GPT-5.5.

The assignment PDF text was provided as context, with the additional decision that the client should be a TUI rather than a web UI. The agent was also instructed to keep responsibilities separated across files instead of putting all logic into `main.py`.
